This is a website, I built using some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, while taking The Complete 2020 Web Developer Bootcamp. It doesn't have too many features, but I want to keep it here as a reminder to myself, of how much I can improve.

For anyone that starts to learn how to code, I recomend taking this course on https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/
